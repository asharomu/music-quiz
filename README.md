# music-quiz

This game is written using ReactJS based on React Fundamentals.
Redux was used for state management.

The game is a music quiz where the picture of an artist is shown so that the user gets to choose the correct song performed by the artist. If you select the correct answer, a green highlighted area will pop up. If the answer is wrong, a red area will pop up. 

A form was also implemented to add new artists. To open the form, click the option on the bottom left corner and add name, image and songs.
